LINEAR PROBE
while current array is not empty increase current index by 1. 
Use modulus

while(array[inde % array.length] != null && count >= 0)

REHASHING
Correct Constant
K is not factor of size and K is prime. Then constant is K. 

Check by using constant, added to index. 

NOTES FOR EAHST
init count as array.length
while object at index [index % arraay.length] !+ null && count > 0 {
--index += constant
--conunt--;
if(count < 0) return -1; 
return index; 

Index += constant
Contains method same, instead of adding 1, add constant. Modulus array.length

Chaining constructur
Instatiate array as LinkdedList;
Each thing in array is also LinkedList; 
Use isEmpthy method for add() method 
AddFirst method, to add to beginning

For chaining contains method, ifelse structure not needed. Iteration (... or .contains()? )
